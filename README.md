# Random Stitch Generator

Use this app to decide which stitch to use next while making a front/back post double crochet beanie. That way, each beanie will be unique and random looking. Requires `poetry`, `python-tk`, `python3.12`.

To begin, run `source init.sh` on mac. This will also launch the app.

To use the app after closing, run `python src/app.py`
